# How to Guide
To run the commented out SQL queries, uncomment them and click the run button in the top right hand corner in main.py - these lines run from line 103-246. You can uncomment the queries individually by looking at the key in lines 103-112 and seeing which query you wish to uncomment. Scroll down to that query and uncomment it between the hashes that separate it from other queries.

To run the application, uncomment the lines 247-280 and click the run button in the top right hand corner in main.py, choose with numbers 1-7 which function you would like to run.
